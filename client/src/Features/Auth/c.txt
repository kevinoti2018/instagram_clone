I stand to gain an even stronger and deeper understanding in programming and also the opportunity to interact ,learn and grow with like minded people. I will also gain access to the resources provided by the program be to human or learning materials. I also stand a chance to be a part of the Power Learn Project vast community and reap its benefits such as networking ,mentorship and the countless events which will accord me the chance to put my skills into practice whilst challenging me to come up with solutions to problems through technology and innovation.



Hopefully spearheading technological innovations which are tailored towards user/client needs .i also plan on starting software development communities in the informal settlements which will aim in providing support , mentorship and an equal chance in the information technology world. The steps i am taking to acheive them:
1. Networking extensively with people from the IT field.
2. Taking part in boot camps and hackathons to sharpen my skills.
3. Staying vigilant o available opportunities in the field.
4. Being disciplined and consistent in my coding journey.
5. Partnering with companies and organisations with the same goals as mine.
